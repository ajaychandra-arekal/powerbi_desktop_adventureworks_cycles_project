### AdventureWorks Cycles Analytics Project - Power BI Desktop

This repository contains my completed project for the Power BI Desktop course, where I served as a Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. This project demonstrates my skills in transforming raw data into insightful, professional-quality reports and dashboards that track KPIs, regional performance, product trends, and customer segments.

### Project Overview

In this project, I utilized the full BI workflow in Power BI Desktop, including data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization. I followed best practices throughout each stage to build a polished, interactive dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles.

### Project Stages

Connecting & Shaping Data
- Connected to various data sources, cleaned, transformed, and loaded data with Power Query.
- Key techniques: merging/appending queries, pivoting/unpivoting, data profiling, conditional columns, and rolling calendars.
 
Building a Relational Data Model
- Developed a structured data model with fact and dimension tables, applying database normalization, star schema modeling, and proper relationships for optimized filtering.
- Key concepts: star schemas, primary & foreign keys, cardinality, bi-directional filters, and hierarchies.
 
Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
- Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures, enabling advanced analytics and insights.
- Key functions: CALCULATE, FILTER, time intelligence patterns, iterators, SWITCH, and logical functions.
 
Visualizing Data with Reports
- Designed interactive reports and dashboards with best practices for data visualization, using slicers, tooltips, custom visuals, and more.
- Key visuals: KPIs, line charts, matrix tables, map visuals, bookmarks, drill-through filters, and custom tooltips.
